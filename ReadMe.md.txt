#Code Refacting Horiseon Website HW1
---

This is my first ReadMe markdown explaining the homework for week 1 of class.

##Lessons learned from the assignment.
---

I learned quite a bit while cleaning up the code and finding where certain HTML elements can be
implemented. There were quite a few attempts at fiddling with certain parts of the code and many
many trial and errors before the code fit right, by the end of it, there was quite a clear 
understanding of how parents and children classes are formatted between the index and style
sheet.

>Stay diligent and know that this will all be very much worth it by the end of the course :)
